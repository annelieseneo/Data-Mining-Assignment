# Data Mining Assignment

Task Highlights :

- Association rule mining

a) Clean the data using preprocessing techniques that are needed for this dataset. 

b) Discretize attributes Age and Hours_Per_week into three discrete levels. 

c) Calculate all items sets (from one item to the maximum number of items you can find) using Apriori method. Prune the item sets with minimum support of 50% and minimum confidence of 75%. 

d) List out all association rules (strong rules) with this meta template : * => “>50K”

- Decision tree

a) Give proper labels to the attributes that have values with a range of numbers.

b) Construct a decision tree based on information gain. Then, extracting classification rules from the tree. 

- Naïve Bayesian

a) Construct a probability table. Note that Hours_Per_week will not be discretised, but instead the probability will be calculated by assuming a normal data distribution.

b) Predict whether a person with the following characteristics would have income higher than 50K :

i) The person is 35 years old, has Bachelor degree, and works 43 per week.

ii) What will be changed if this person works for governments or works in Private companies? 

iii) Effect of marital status on the Income

iv) The person is 55 years old, without higher education degree (having less than bachelor degree), married, and works 50 per week in a private company.
